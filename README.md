1.)Upon logging into the helpdesk via the admin/ analyst link (http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php) I found myseelf in the tickets tab.

2.) Configuring roles:
  
  Navigate to "Agents" tab -> select "Roles" -> then "add new role". From there you can name the role you want to create as well as choose/ group permissions it will be granted. In this case, the name given was "Supreme admin" and it was given "full access" hence the name.

</p>
<p>
3.) Configuring departments:

"Agents" -> "Departments". Just like I did when I created a new role, I am naming the department and choosing what access will be granted to members of said apartment.
